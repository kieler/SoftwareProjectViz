# Software Project Visualization
SoftwareProjectViz is a visualization generator for your arbitrary (software) project.
Based on the visualization and interaction style of [osgiviz](https://github.com/kieler/osgiviz) this project takes that idea and abstracts it,
so that you can let this project generate visualizations for your project,
browse the connections within your systems,
and use it to document the architecture designs of your project.
Usable in Eclipse, VS Code, standalone websites, or built into your automatically updating project documentation,
the visualizations of this project utilizing the [KLighD](https://github.com/kieler/klighd) framework and its web-integration [KLighD-VSCode](https://github.com/kieler/klighd-vscode) can be configured and used in various environments to fit your needs.

## Developing a visualization
You can develop your own visualization or one of the examples using the Eclipse IDE.
For a guide on how to install and use this, have a look into the [wiki](https://github.com/kieler/SoftwareProjectViz/wiki/How-to-use-this).
